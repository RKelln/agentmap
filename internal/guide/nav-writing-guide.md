# Nav Writing Guide

This is the canonical reference for writing AGENT:NAV block descriptions.

**Scope:** `purpose`, `about`, and `see` fields.
Do not hand-edit metadata (`s`, `n`, `nav[N]`, `see[N]`) or line numbers — `agentmap update` manages that.

---

## The Mental Model

An agent navigating a codebase opens a file based on a guess — a filename, an index entry, a
search result. The nav block is read immediately to validate that guess:

- **`purpose`** — confirms or rejects the guess. The agent already has the file open; `purpose`
  tells it whether it guessed right. Must be specific enough to rule in *and* rule out quickly.
- **`about`** — routes within the file once confirmed. The agent reads only the sections that
  answer its question, skipping the rest.
- **`see`** — exit ramp when the guess was wrong. Points directly to the right file without a
  new search.

All three decisions happen under token pressure with no additional context. Every word costs
tokens. A vague or redundant description forces the agent to read sections it shouldn't have
to — defeating the nav block entirely.

**The goal of every description:** enable a confirm/route/exit decision with no further reading.

Two properties matter above all others:

1. **Disambiguation** — distinguishes this entry from its siblings. An agent can only navigate if
   descriptions differ meaningfully. `token management` fails when three sections exist; `sliding-window expiry` does not.
2. **Decision support** — contains enough information to act on. If the agent still needs to read
   the section to know whether it's relevant, the description failed.

Everything else — word count, filler avoidance, format — is in service of these two.

## Quick Reference

```
<!-- AGENT:NAV
purpose:one-line file summary; no commas
nav[N]{s,n,name,about}:
s,n,#Heading,one-line section summary; don't repeat heading; no commas>subsection
see[N]{path,why}:
relative/path.md,linked file purpose relative to this file
-->
```

**Order is strict:** `purpose` first, then `nav[...]` and its entries, then optional `see[...]` and its entries, then closing `-->`.

---

## 1. Before You Write

Read the AGENT:NAV block first. This gives you purpose, section names,
and line ranges before you commit to reading further.

Never hand-edit nav line metadata while doing description work. Keep your edits to `purpose`, `about`,
and `see`; then run `agentmap update` to refresh line numbers.

Use line ranges from the nav block to read only what you need:

```
Read(offset=s, limit=n)    # read exactly the section flagged by update
```

Skim the full section content before writing its description. A description written from the heading
alone is usually wrong — the actual content often surprises. For sections with `>` hints (e.g.
`topic>sub1;sub2;sub3`), read the subsections too before writing the parent `about`.

---

## 2. Starting from Scratch

Don't craft a nav block by hand and then run `agentmap generate` — it will overwrite your work.

The correct workflow for a new file:
1. Write the file content (no nav block yet).
2. Run `agentmap generate <file>` — writes a skeleton with `~`-prefixed descriptions.
3. Rewrite each `~` description with human-quality text.
4. Run `agentmap update <file>` to confirm line numbers are current.
5. Commit.

## 3. Writing `purpose` Lines

`purpose` is a one-line summary of the **entire file**. The agent reads it to confirm or reject
its guess about whether this is the right file.

**Rules:** under 10 words; no commas (use semicolons); no `~` prefix after you write it.

**Write for the sibling question:** a file doesn't exist alone — it sits next to others on the
same topic. `purpose` must distinguish *this* file from its neighbours. Prefer concrete nouns
and mechanisms over category labels.

| | Example |
|---|---|
| Bad — auto noise | `~authentication OAuth2 PKCE token flow redirect` |
| Bad — too vague | `Overview of the authentication system and how it works` |
| Bad — category label | `authentication system` |
| Good | `token lifecycle; OAuth2 exchange; refresh and revocation policies` |

**Ask yourself:** if I read only this line, would I know whether I'm in the right file *vs.* a neighbour on the same topic?

---

## 4. Writing `about` Fields

`about` is a one-line summary of **one section**. An agent already reading this file uses it to
jump directly to the right section without reading each one.

**Rules:** under 10 words; no commas; no `~` prefix after you write it.

**Prefer noun phrases over sentences.** `sliding-window expiry and silent rotation` is faster to
scan and more precise than `how token expiry and rotation work`. Concrete terms beat category
labels: `PKCE code exchange` beats `authorization flow`.

### The anti-restatement rule

**`about` must never restate the heading.** The heading is already visible in the `name` field.
Repeating it wastes the slot and gives the reader nothing to act on.

**If you cannot add new information, leave `about` empty** — a trailing comma with nothing after it
(`43,9,#Heading,`) is valid and preferable to noise. Self-explanatory headings like `##Summary` or
`##Open Questions` often need no `about`.

| | Example (heading: `##Token Refresh`) |
|---|---|
| Bad — restates heading | `token refresh` |
| Bad — restates with filler | `overview of token refresh` |
| Bad — still has `~` | `~silent rotation expiry detection` |
| Good — adds new information | `silent rotation and sliding-window expiry` |
| Good — nothing to add | _(empty)_ |

**Ask yourself:** would an agent skip the right section based on this description alone?
If it could plausibly apply to a sibling section — rewrite it.

### Sections with `>` hints

Some sections are large enough to need subsection routing but not large enough to give each
subsection its own nav entry. For those, `agentmap generate` appends a `>` suffix to the `about`
field — one hint per subsection that would otherwise have no nav representation. This keeps the
nav block compact while still letting an agent identify which subsection to jump to.

**Format:** `description>sub1;sub2;sub3` — the `>` is appended directly to the description text
with **no space** before it.

```
# The full field value (everything after the comma):
token lifecycle; OAuth2 exchange>token-exchange;token-refresh;revocation
│                              ││                                       │
└─── about description ────────┘└─── subsection hints ──────────────────┘
```

`agentmap generate` produces hints as verbatim subsection heading text — a scaffold, not a final
answer. When you review a `~` entry that has hints, rewrite the whole value: description and hints
together. Choose 1-2 words per hint that best encapsulate that subsection. They may be the most
important words from the heading, but use judgment — the goal is the shortest label an agent could
scan to decide which subsection to jump to.

```
# Before (auto-generated scaffold):
51,80,##Token Exchange,~OAuth2 PKCE authorization code token exchange>PKCE Authorization Code;Client Credentials;Device Authorization

# After (agent-written) — full value rewritten, ~ removed:
51,80,##Token Exchange,OAuth2 code-for-token flow>PKCE;client-credentials;device-flow
```

**Rules for `>` hints:**
- One hint per subsection that has no nav entry of its own — don't add or drop entries, just rewrite the text.
- 1-2 words per hint; no commas (use hyphens for compound terms).
- The description before `>` must still pass the anti-restatement rule on its own.
- `agentmap update` preserves the full `about` value (description and hints) unchanged.

---

## 5. Adding `see` Entries

`see` lists files that are closely related — files an agent working here would likely need next.

**When to add:**
- The file you're writing links to another file in markdown.
- Another file defines types; configs; or constants used here.
- The two files must be read together to understand a feature.

**When not to add:** don't list every adjacent file. Only add entries that save a real search.

**Placement rule:** add `see` entries after the nav entries inside the same AGENT:NAV block.
Do not insert `see` above `purpose` or above `nav[...]`.

**Format:** `relative/path/from/repo/root.md,linked file purpose relative to this file`

```
see[2]{path,why}:
src/config.py,default timeout and token TTL values
docs/error-policy.md,error handling for auth failures
```

`why` should describe the linked file's purpose in this context. Keep it short, specific,
and free of filler words. `why` must not contain commas; use semicolons if needed.

---

## 6. The `~` Prefix

`~` at the start of a `purpose` or `about` value means: **auto-generated; never reviewed**.

```
purpose:~token OAuth2 authentication flow       # auto-generated
purpose:token lifecycle; OAuth2 exchange flow   # agent-reviewed
```

When you rewrite a description, remove the `~`. This signals that a human or agent has reviewed it.
`agentmap update` preserves `~` unchanged — only a deliberate rewrite removes it.

**Why it matters:** The index task list only includes files that still have `~` descriptions.
Removing `~` marks the section done. Files where every description has been reviewed drop off the
work list.

Do not remove `~` from a description you haven't actually improved — that defeats the tracking.

---

## 7. Quality Checklist

Before committing a description, check:

**1. Disambiguation** — Does it distinguish this entry from its siblings? If a sibling description
could be swapped in without loss — rewrite it.

**2. Decision support** — Could an agent identify the right section from this description
alone, without reading it? If not — it's too vague.

**3. No restatement** — Does it add information the heading doesn't already give? If not — leave it blank.

**4. Concrete terms** — Does it name a mechanism; policy; or concept rather than a category?
`sliding-window expiry` over `expiry details`; `PKCE code exchange` over `authorization flow`.

**5. Format** — Under 10 words; no commas; `~` removed.
